### UI/UX Improvements
- [ ] **Connection indicator**: Visual indicator of online/offline status
- [ ] **Sync status**: Show last sync time and sync in progress indicators
- [ ] **Error messages**: User-friendly error messages for network failures
- [ ] **Loading states**: Proper loading indicators during API calls

### Data Management
- [ ] **Hybrid storage**: Seamless integration between local Hive and server data
- [ ] **Data consistency**: Ensure UI always shows most current data (local or server)
- [ ] **Background sync**: Automatic sync when app returns to foreground
